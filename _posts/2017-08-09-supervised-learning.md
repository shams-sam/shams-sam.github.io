### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of **inferring a function from labeled training data**. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).

* **Regression**: When the target variable is **continuous**. Regression in supervised learning is different from regression in statistics. Also, **logistic regression** is a classification technique despite its name as its response variable is categorical.

  * **Example**: Given a picture of a person, predict the age on the basis of the given picture.

* **Classification**: When the target variable is **categorical**. 

  * **Example**: Given a patient with a tumor, predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to **draw inferences from datasets** consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is **cluster analysis**, which is used for **exploratory data analysis** to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.

* **Clustering**: Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

* **Applications**:
  * Organizing large computing clusters
  * Social network analysis
  * Market segmentation
  * Astronomical data analysis

  * **Cocktail Party Algorithm**: It is an example of **source seperation** algorithm or **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**. It can be considered to be opposite of clustering in some sense.

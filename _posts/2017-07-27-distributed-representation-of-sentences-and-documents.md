### Drawbacks of Bag-of-Words Models
* Loss of word order which may be of importance in infering the meaning of sentence.
* Ignoring the semantics of the words i.e. different words may mean different things in different contexts.
* **Bag-of-n-grams** considers word only only in a short context and brings in **data sparsity** and **high dimentionality**.

## The Natural Numbers

> God created natural numbers; everything else is man's handiwork.

The natural numbers were created by the human mind out of the necessity to count the objects around us. Most basics of mathematics are associated with association of numbers with tangible objects. But advanced mathematics is built on top of the abstract concept of number system.

### Laws of Arithmetic

Natural numbers have only two basic operations, namely, addition and multiplication. The mathematical theory of the natural numbers or positive integers is known as arithmetic. Arithmetic is based on the fact that operations on numbers are governed by certain laws.

(a, b, c ... symbolically denote integers)

The fundamental laws of arithmetic are:

* Commutative law, i.e. \\(a+b = b+a\\) and \\(ab = ba\\)
* Associative law, i.e. \\(a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\\) and \\(a(bc) = (ab)c\\)
* Distributive law, i.e. \\(a(b+c) = ab + ac\\)

Addition and subtraction are inverse operations because, \\((a+d)-d = a\\). Similarly, multiplication and division are inverse because \\({a \over d} \cdot d = a\\). Also, 0 and 1 are the identities of operations addition and multiplication respectively.

### Representation of Integers

A number system has a set of digit symbols and numbers where digit symbols are used to denote the larger numbers not available directly in the set of digit symbols. Modern number systems are associated with the place values of individual digits in the number, such as,

$$ 372 = 3 \cdot 10^2 + 7 \cdot 10^1 + 2 \cdot 10^0$$

These are called positional notations. Here, a large number can also be represented using the basic symbols from the set of digit symbols.
